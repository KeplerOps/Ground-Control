# Ground-Control plan rules

Mandatory constraints the `/implement` skill applies during plan phase.

- Plans that add database migrations MUST update the hardcoded version
  lists in `MigrationSmokeTest.java` and
  `RequirementsE2EIntegrationTest.java`.
- Plans that add `@Audited` JPA entities MUST add `@NotAudited` on any
  `@ManyToOne` references to non-audited entities (e.g., Project), and
  MUST include a Flyway migration for the `_audit` table.
- Plans that add API endpoints MUST include `@WebMvcTest` controller
  unit tests (not just integration tests). The sonar CI job does not run
  Testcontainers, so only unit tests contribute to SonarCloud coverage.
- Plans whose diff touches application source (`backend/src/main/**`,
  `backend/src/test/**`, `frontend/src/**`, `mcp/**`, or `tools/**`
  outside `tools/policy/` and `tools/tests/`) MUST drop a changelog
  fragment under `changelog.d/<issue>.<type>.md` (or
  `changelog.d/+<slug>.<type>.md` for issue-free entries), where
  `<type>` is one of `security`, `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`,
  `removed`, `fixed`. CI-only diffs (paths under `.github/workflows/`
  only) and docs-only diffs (paths under `docs/**`, `architecture/**`,
  `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gc/**`, `skills/**`, and equivalent
  metadata) may ship without a fragment. There is no "pure refactor"
  carve-out — the policy is path-based, so a behavior-preserving
  refactor under an application-source path still files a fragment
  (a one-line `### Changed - Internal refactor of X` is fine). Do NOT
  edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly — release-time `towncrier build`
  collates fragments into the changelog. See `changelog.d/README.md`
  for the convention. Enforced by
  `tools/policy/checks.py::run_changelog_fragment_check` (codes
  `changelog-signal-missing` and `changelog-fragment-invalid-name`).
