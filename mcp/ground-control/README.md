# Ground Control MCP Server

MCP server wrapping the Ground Control REST API plus a small set of
Ground-Control-specific workflow tools, including Codex-backed architecture
preflight and review helpers.

## Setup

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`.claude/settings.json` or project
`.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ground-control": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Ground-Control/mcp/ground-control/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GC_BASE_URL": "http://red-dragon:8000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requires a reachable Ground Control instance. For local backend development:

```sh
make up && make dev
```

`GC_BASE_URL` is required. The repo does not provide a committed default host.
Set it in your user-local MCP config or shell environment.

### Bearer token (ADR-026)

Production deployments enforce `groundcontrol.security.enabled=true` and
require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/api/v1/**` call. The
MCP server reads the token from a `.env` file in the consumer repo's
root (the cwd it was launched from) at startup:

```sh
# In each repo where you start Claude Code / Codex against Ground Control:
cp .env.example .env       # if your repo has the template — Ground-Control does
chmod 600 .env
# Edit .env and set GROUND_CONTROL_API_TOKEN=<32-byte-hex token>
```

The token never appears in `.mcp.json` and is never exposed to the LLM.
A shell-exported `GROUND_CONTROL_API_TOKEN` still wins over the `.env`
value for one-off / CI callers that prefer the env-var-only flow. Make
sure `.env` is gitignored.

The legacy `GROUND_CONTROL_PACK_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN` is also resolved
from `.env`; it is preferred over `GROUND_CONTROL_API_TOKEN` for paths
requiring `ROLE_ADMIN` (`/api/v1/admin/**`, `/api/v1/embeddings/**`,
`/api/v1/analysis/sweep/**`, `/api/v1/pack-registry/**`).

Codex-backed workflow tools additionally require the Codex CLI to be installed
and available on `PATH`.

## Admin-tool opt-in (`GC_MCP_ADMIN`)

The `gc_admin` and `gc_pack` consolidated tools wrap `/api/v1/admin/**`,
`/api/v1/embeddings/**`, `/api/v1/analysis/sweep/**`, and
`/api/v1/pack-registry/**` operations that require `ROLE_ADMIN` at the
backend (per ADR-026). To avoid surfacing those write/mutating actions to
a default MCP session that happens to have an admin bearer token in its
environment, both tools are registered **only when `GC_MCP_ADMIN=1`** (or
`true` / `yes`). Without the flag, neither tool appears in the catalog. A
session that needs admin operations sets the env var explicitly:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ground-control-admin": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Ground-Control/mcp/ground-control/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GC_BASE_URL": "http://red-dragon:8000",
        "GC_MCP_ADMIN": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Backend `ROLE_ADMIN` still enforces authorization; this flag controls only
which named MCP tools are advertised to the LLM.

## Tool surface (ADR-035)

The MCP server registers **~30 named tools** plus the read-only `gc_query`
escape hatch, down from 215 in earlier versions. The surface was consolidated
under ADR-035 by combining `gc_create_X` / `gc_get_X` / `gc_list_X` /
`gc_update_X` / `gc_delete_X` per-entity tools into a single
`gc_<entity>` tool with an `action` discriminator, and by moving pure-read
GETs (history, timeline, exports, list-by-X) onto `gc_query`.

**Workflow primitives** (called by name from the `/implement` and `/ship`
skills' SKILL.md prose, kept unchanged):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gc_get_repo_ground_control_context` | Read repo's `.ground-control.yaml` |
| `gc_dashboard_stats` | Aggregate project health snapshot |
| `gc_get_requirement` | Get requirement by UID |
| `gc_get_traceability` | Get all traceability links for a requirement |
| `gc_get_traceability_by_artifact` | Reverse lookup: artifact → requirements |
| `gc_create_traceability_link` | Link an artifact to a requirement |
| `gc_delete_traceability_link` | Delete a traceability link |
| `gc_transition_status` | Transition a requirement's status |
| `gc_bulk_transition_status` | Transition many requirements at once |
| `gc_create_github_issue` | Create a GitHub issue from a requirement |
| `gc_codex_architecture_preflight` | Codex preflight before `/implement` |
| `gc_post_implementation_plan` | Post plan to issue thread |
| `gc_codex_review` | Run Codex review with cycle caps |
| `gc_codex_verify_finding` | Verify a specific finding resolved |
| `gc_query` | Read-only ad-hoc `/api/v1/*` GET (see below) |

**Consolidated entity tools** (one per entity, action-discriminated):

| Tool | Actions |
|---|---|
| `gc_requirement` | list, create, update, delete, archive, clone |
| `gc_relation` | create, get, delete |
| `gc_adr` | create, update, delete, transition, requirements |
| `gc_document` | create, update, delete, grammar_set, grammar_delete, reading_order |
| `gc_section` | create, update, delete, tree, content_add, content_update, content_delete |
| `gc_asset` | create, update, delete, archive, relation_*, link_*, external_id_* |
| `gc_observation` | create, update, delete, latest |
| `gc_risk_scenario` | create, update, delete, transition, requirements, link_* |
| `gc_threat_model` | create, update, delete, transition, link_* |
| `gc_control` | create, update, delete, transition, link_* |
| `gc_risk_governance` | `{entity, action}` over methodology_profile, risk_register_record, risk_assessment_result, treatment_plan, verification_result |
| `gc_analyze` | cycles, orphans, coverage_gaps, impact, cross_wave, consistency, completeness, status_drift, similarity, work_order |
| `gc_graph` | ancestors, descendants, paths, find_paths, subgraph, visualization, traverse |
| `gc_baseline` | create, delete, snapshot, compare |
| `gc_quality_gate` | create, update, delete, evaluate |
| `gc_admin` | imports, sync, embeddings, materialize_graph, project, sweep, exports |
| `gc_pack` | `{subsystem, action}` over plugin, control_pack, registry, trust_policy, install |

Reads (list, get-by-id, history, diff, timeline, exports) for any entity go
through `gc_query` against the appropriate `/api/v1/*` path.

## Read-only ad-hoc queries via `gc_query`

`gc_query` is a tightly bounded GET-only escape hatch into `/api/v1/**` for
hypothesis-checking that the curated tools don't pre-bake. It is registered
under the `workflow` catalog, so it is always available.

- **Method:** GET only (no `method` parameter exists).
- **Path:** must be a relative `/api/v1/...` path under one of the
  allowlisted prefixes. Absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, `..` segments,
  embedded `?` / `#`, and any path outside `/api/v1/` are rejected before any
  network call.
- **Allowlist (canonical source: `GC_QUERY_PATH_ALLOWLIST` in
  `mcp/ground-control/gc-query.js`):**
  `/api/v1/adrs`, `/api/v1/analysis`, `/api/v1/assets`, `/api/v1/audit`,
  `/api/v1/baselines`, `/api/v1/controls`, `/api/v1/dashboard`,
  `/api/v1/documents`, `/api/v1/graph`, `/api/v1/methodology-profiles`,
  `/api/v1/observations`, `/api/v1/projects`, `/api/v1/quality-gates`,
  `/api/v1/relations`, `/api/v1/requirements`,
  `/api/v1/risk-assessment-results`, `/api/v1/risk-register-records`,
  `/api/v1/risk-scenarios`, `/api/v1/sections`, `/api/v1/threat-models`,
  `/api/v1/timeline`, `/api/v1/traceability`, `/api/v1/treatment-plans`,
  `/api/v1/verification-results`. A drift-catch test
  (`gc-query.test.js`) compares this list against the implementation
  constant on every test run, so the README is the documentation surface
  but the constant in `gc-query.js` is the truth.
- **Denylist:** `/api/v1/admin/**`, `/api/v1/embeddings/**`,
  `/api/v1/analysis/sweep/**`, `/api/v1/pack-registry/**` are rejected even
  though they live under `/api/v1/`. The denylist takes precedence over the
  allowlist when prefixes overlap (e.g., `/api/v1/analysis` is allowed but
  `/api/v1/analysis/sweep` is denied).
- **Headers:** none accepted. `X-Actor: mcp-server` and the bearer token
  resolved from `GROUND_CONTROL_API_TOKEN` (or the legacy admin token, when
  appropriate per ADR-026's path matrix) are added automatically.
- **Params:** flat object, values must be `string | number | boolean | null`.
  `undefined` and `null` are dropped before URL construction.
- **Cost cap:** 30s timeout via `AbortController`; 1 MiB response-body cap
  with a clear truncation marker. Larger results need the catalog tool that
  paginates the resource (in `analysis` or `requirements`).

Adding a new read endpoint to the agent's reach requires updating the
`GC_QUERY_PATH_ALLOWLIST` constant in `mcp/ground-control/gc-query.js`. The
default-deny posture is intentional.

## Workflow

Operations have a natural ordering. Requirements must exist before they can
be related, linked, or analyzed.

1. **Create requirements** — `gc_create_requirement` with uid, title, statement
2. **Create relations** — `gc_create_relation` between two existing requirements
3. **Add traceability links** — `gc_create_traceability_link` to connect code, tests, issues, ADRs
4. **Run analysis** — `gc_analyze_cycles`, `gc_analyze_orphans`, `gc_analyze_coverage_gaps`, `gc_analyze_impact`, `gc_analyze_cross_wave`, `gc_analyze_consistency`, `gc_analyze_completeness`, `gc_analyze_status_drift`
5. **Embed requirements** — `gc_embed_project` to generate vector embeddings, `gc_analyze_similarity` to find near-duplicates
6. **Transition status** — `gc_transition_status` moves requirements forward: DRAFT → ACTIVE → DEPRECATED → ARCHIVED
7. **Bulk operations** — `gc_import_strictdoc` for .sdoc files, `gc_import_reqif` for .reqif files, `gc_sync_github` for issue sync
8. **Manage baselines** — `gc_create_baseline`, `gc_compare_baselines` for release management

## Enums

**Status:** `DRAFT`, `ACTIVE`, `DEPRECATED`, `ARCHIVED`

**Requirement type:** `FUNCTIONAL`, `NON_FUNCTIONAL`, `CONSTRAINT`, `INTERFACE`

**Priority (MoSCoW):** `MUST`, `SHOULD`, `COULD`, `WONT`

**Relation type:** `PARENT`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `CONFLICTS_WITH`, `REFINES`, `SUPERSEDES`, `RELATED`

**Artifact type:** `GITHUB_ISSUE`, `CODE_FILE`, `ADR`, `CONFIG`, `POLICY`, `TEST`, `SPEC`, `PROOF`, `DOCUMENTATION`

**Link type:** `IMPLEMENTS`, `TESTS`, `DOCUMENTS`, `CONSTRAINS`, `VERIFIES`

## Status Transitions

Forward-only. No backward transitions.

```
DRAFT → ACTIVE → DEPRECATED → ARCHIVED
```

`gc_transition_status` enforces this. `gc_archive_requirement` is a shortcut
that transitions directly to ARCHIVED (must already be DEPRECATED).

## Error Handling

Errors return:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Requirement not found",
    "detail": {}
  }
}
```

Common codes: `NOT_FOUND` (404), `CONFLICT` (409), `VALIDATION_ERROR` (422).

## IDs

`gc_create_requirement` and `gc_get_requirement` use `uid` (human-readable,
e.g. `REQ-001`). All other tools use `id` (UUID, returned in create/list
responses).

For cross-repo workflow automation, define repo-local Ground Control context in a `.ground-control.yaml` file at the repo root. At minimum it must declare `schema_version: 1` and a `project` identifier; optional sections include `workflow`, `sonarcloud`, `rules`, `knowledge`, `routing`, `telemetry`, plus the workflow-packaging fields added in ADR-027: `docs.{adr_dir, architecture_overview, coding_standards, workflow_reference, knowledge_base}`, `example_paths.{source, test}`, `requirements.uid_examples`, and `cross_cutting_concerns.description`. The canonical `skills/implement/SKILL.md` renders prose against these fields via `{cfg.X|default Y}` placeholders so one source of truth serves every Ground-Control-aware repo. The `gc_get_repo_ground_control_context` MCP tool reads and validates this file and returns inlined `plan_rules` content plus resolved `knowledge` paths and the workflow-packaging blocks when those sections are configured. `gc_resolve_workflow_route` reads the same config and resolves `routing.stages.<stage>` entries to executable provider/model/fallback decisions. See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full accepted config shape, defaults, allowed routing values, and validation constraints. `buildSuggestedGroundControlYaml()` in `lib.js` is only the starter template.

## Codex review architecture (privileged side-effect boundary)

Per ADR-027 and issue #793, the codex-backed review tools follow a strict separation of concerns:

- **Codex is the planner / reviewer.** It runs in a `read-only` sandbox with no GitHub credentials and returns structured payloads only. It must never invoke `gh`, `git`, or `curl` to post comments.
- **The MCP server is the GitHub poster.** It validates codex's payloads against the schema below, then performs all GitHub writes (inline review comments, threaded replies, thread-resolution mutations, phase markers, cycle markers) from the host's authenticated `gh`.

`gc_codex_review` consumes a `===FINDINGS===…===END===` JSON tail from each reviewer's stdout. The MCP server validates each finding lexically (path lives inside the repo, line is positive or null, body is non-empty and within GitHub's 65535-char limit) and then POSTs each finding to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments` with the PR's current head SHA. The `[core]` / `[security]` reviewer label is prepended to the comment body by the poster — codex does not include it in the JSON.

Per-finding schema:

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | yes | repo-relative, no leading `/`, no `..` segments |
| `line` | integer | yes | positive integer (file-level comments are not yet supported; every finding must anchor to a line in the diff) |
| `title` | string | yes | non-empty, ≤200 characters |
| `body` | string | yes | non-empty, ≤65322 characters (leaves headroom for the poster's `[reviewerLabel] title\n\n` prefix to keep the rendered comment under GitHub's 65535-char limit) |

The tool response carries both findings and write results, including any per-finding POST failures under `post_failures` (so callers can see partial-write conditions without parsing logs) and any per-reviewer parse errors under `parse_errors`.

`gc_codex_verify_finding` and `gc_codex_architecture_preflight` follow the same boundary: codex emits a structured decision (verify) or modifies design docs in-place (preflight); the MCP server posts the threaded reply, resolves the review thread, and writes phase markers from the host.
