Always use the package manager to install dependencies.
Always follow the coding standards.
Keep docs and ADRs up to date.
Always do the right thing, not the easy thing.

## Build

This is a Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.4 / Gradle project.

- Rapid dev loop: `make rapid` (format + compile, ~3-5s)
- Test: `make test` (unit tests, no static analysis)
- Policy: `make policy` (repo-native ADR/workflow guardrails shared by Claude and Codex)
- Format: `cd backend && ./gradlew spotlessApply`
- Lint: `cd backend && ./gradlew spotlessCheck`
- Full check: `make check` (CI-equivalent: build + tests + all static analysis)
- Full verify: `make verify` (check + integration tests + OpenJML ESC)
- Run: `cd backend && ./gradlew bootRun`

Use `make rapid` for the inner dev loop. Use `make check` before pushing.
If you touched workflow, ADR, controller, migration, or MCP surfaces, run `make policy` as well.

## Frontend

React 19 / Vite 6 / TypeScript 5 / Tailwind 4 app in `frontend/`.

- Install: `cd frontend && npm install`
- Dev server: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (proxies `/api` to `:8000`)
- Build: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Lint: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
- Format: `cd frontend && npm run format`

Or use `make frontend-install`, `make frontend-dev`, `make frontend-build`, etc.

## Package

`com.keplerops.groundcontrol`

Architecture: `api/ -> domain/ <- infrastructure/` (enforced by ArchUnit).
Domain layer has no Spring web imports.

## Development Philosophy (Pre-Alpha)

Ship features, not ceremony. L0 is the default assurance level. Add JML contracts only where invalid input causes silent data corruption (state transitions, security boundaries). One test per significant behavior. See docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md and ADR-012 for the full framework.

When implementing a feature, query Ground Control for related requirements. After completing work, create IMPLEMENTS and TESTS traceability links for any requirements you satisfied.

## Code Review

Don't surface nitpicks about PR titles or descriptions unless they are grossly misleading.

## Implementation

Always check your work against the requirement you are implementing to be sure you have implemented all the functionality described in the requirement.

## Answer Questions

If you are asked a question that you don't know the answer to but you have the means to find the facts, go find the facts and answer the question. This is especially important for questions about the codebase, requirements, or the project. You have all the tools at your disposal to answer any of thess questions, so use them.
