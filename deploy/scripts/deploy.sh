# Ground Control manual deploy helper.
#
# This is the repo copy of the script that lives on red-dragon at
# /opt/gc/deploy.sh and runs as the SSH forced-command target for the
# `gc-deploy` user (per ADR-030). The CI deploy job invokes it as
# `ssh gc-deploy@red-dragon` (no arguments). It is also a valid manual
# entry point for the operator from any tailnet host:
#
#   ssh gc-deploy@red-dragon              # CI / forced-command path (no args)
#   ssh red-dragon /opt/gc/deploy.sh      # operator path; same forced command
#   ./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh <image-ref> # local override; see below
#
# When invoked locally with an image-ref argument, this script rewrites
# /opt/gc/.env's GC_IMAGE line to that ref before pulling. The argument
# accepts any GHCR reference: a tag (`:latest`, `:dev`, `:sha-1a69bc3`)
# or a digest (`@sha256:...`). Production deployments pin to a digest in
# /opt/gc/.env directly; this override is for one-off rollbacks or
# operator-driven verification of a specific image.
#
# Note: the legacy AWS / SSM / refresh-env.sh path was removed when
# ADR-030 retired the AWS deployment. There is no SSM lookup; the
# canonical credential / config source is /opt/gc/.env (mode 600,
# operator-managed).

# Optional: rewrite GC_IMAGE to the supplied ref. The ref is taken
# verbatim, so callers that want a digest pin pass the full
# `ghcr.io/keplerops/ground-control@sha256:...` string; tag-style
# `ghcr.io/keplerops/ground-control:dev` also works.
