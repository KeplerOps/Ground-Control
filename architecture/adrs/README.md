# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Ground Control. ADRs capture significant architectural decisions along with their context, rationale, and consequences.

## Format

We use [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Any Decision Records). Each ADR includes:

- **Status**: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, or `superseded by ADR-XXX`
- **Context**: The problem or situation driving the decision
- **Decision**: What we chose and why
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs (positive, negative, risks)

## Principles

- ADRs are **immutable** once accepted. To reverse a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes it.
- ADRs are **numbered sequentially** and never reused.
- ADRs are **versioned with code** — they live in the repo, not a wiki.
