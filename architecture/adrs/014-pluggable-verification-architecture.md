## Context

Ground Control's vision is a verification-aware software lifecycle orchestrator with graph-native artifact traceability. Two landscape analyses ([compass reports](../notes/)) confirm that no platform combines requirements management, formal specifications, threat modeling, code generation, and graph-based artifact traceability — and that the **graph-based artifact layer** is the genuinely novel element.

ADR-013 chose Java 21/Spring Boot and established JML/OpenJML/KeY as the formal methods chain for Ground Control's own code. This chain works for dogfooding — the platform's internal code quality. However, the industrial secure software development use case requires the platform to orchestrate verification of software written in any language, not just Java.

### The polyglot verification problem

Security-critical software spans multiple languages and abstraction levels:

| Target | Domain | Verifiers |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Java services | Enterprise backends | OpenJML ESC, KeY |
| C/C++ | Automotive, aerospace, embedded, firmware | Frama-C, CBMC, TrustInSoft |
| Rust | Systems, security-critical infrastructure | Verus, Kani |
| Go | Cloud native, infrastructure | Dafny (via translation) |
| Smart contracts | Blockchain, DeFi | Certora CVL, Solidity SMTChecker |
| Infrastructure-as-Code | Cloud configuration | OPA/Rego, Checkov |
| Policy-as-Code | Authorization, compliance | OPA/Rego, Kyverno, Cedar |
| System designs | Distributed protocols, state machines | TLA+/TLC, Alloy |

No single prover covers this surface. The successful industrial deployments use the right tool for the right abstraction level:

- **AWS**: TLA+ for design-level verification of distributed protocols, CBMC for C code bounded model checking, Zelkova (custom SMT) for IAM policy verification, Tiros for network reachability. Engineers learn TLA+ in 2-3 weeks.
- **Meta**: Infer (separation logic) runs on every code modification. Over 1,000 bugs caught per month. Developers don't know they're using formal methods.
- **Certora**: AI-generated smart contract code must pass CVL formal verification before deployment. The forcing function is economic: $3.8B stolen from unverified contracts in 2022.

### Design-level vs. code-level verification

The AWS experience shows that design-level verification delivers the highest ROI. TLA+ finds "subtle bugs we are sure we would not have found by other means" — and it operates before code exists.

Ground Control's core complexity maps directly to design-level properties:

- State machine completeness (requirements lifecycle, no deadlocks)
- DAG invariant preservation (concurrent relation creation cannot introduce cycles)
- AGE materialization consistency (graph projection converges to ORM truth)
- Traceability completeness (impact analysis reaches all affected artifacts)
- Multi-prover orchestration correctness (verification pipeline itself)

These are exactly the properties TLA+ and Alloy are designed to verify. Investing here is higher-value than expanding OpenJML ESC coverage from 4 enums to 8.

### The strategic positioning gap

The compass reports identify a critical gap in the market:

- **Spec-driven dev platforms** (AWS Kiro, GitHub Spec Kit, Tessl) enforce process without mathematical guarantees — natural language specs only.
- **Formal-reasoning startups** (Harmonic, Logical Intelligence, Axiom Math) build verification engines without developer-facing platforms.
- **ALM tools** (IBM ELM, Polarion, Jama) handle requirements without formal methods.
- **Formal methods tools** (SCADE, SPARK, Frama-C) verify code without lifecycle awareness.

The whitespace is a platform that connects all of these through a queryable artifact graph. Coupling that graph to a single prover (JML/KeY) would limit the platform to Java and miss the industrial market.

## Decision

### 1. Verification pipeline as orchestration layer

Ground Control's verification pipeline is an **orchestration abstraction**, not a specific prover. The platform invokes the appropriate verifier for the target language and abstraction level, then stores results in the graph as first-class artifacts.

```
                        Graph (AGE)
                            ^
                            | VerificationResult
             +--------------+---------------+
             |              |               |
       +-----+------+ +----+-----+  +------+------+
       |  Design     | |  Code    |  |  Policy     |
       |  Verifiers  | |  Verifiers|  |  Verifiers  |
       +-------------+ +----------+  +-------------+
       | TLA+ / TLC  | | OpenJML  |  | OPA / Rego  |
       | Alloy       | | Frama-C  |  | Kyverno     |
       |             | | Verus    |  | Cedar       |
       |             | | Dafny    |  |             |
       |             | | KeY      |  |             |
       |             | | CBMC     |  |             |
       |             | | Kani     |  |             |
       +-------------+ +----------+  +-------------+
```

Each verifier backend is a thin adapter. Ground Control orchestrates — it does not maintain the provers.

### 2. Prover-agnostic verification results

A `VerificationResult` domain entity captures results from any verifier in a common schema:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| target | FK -> TraceabilityLink | What was verified (code file, spec, config, design model) |
| requirement | FK -> Requirement (nullable) | The requirement driving this verification |
| prover | String | Tool identifier: `openjml-esc`, `key`, `tlaplus-tlc`, `alloy`, `frama-c`, `verus`, `dafny`, `opa`, `cbmc`, `manual-review` |
| property | TEXT | The formal property checked (human-readable description + formal notation) |
| result | Enum | `PROVEN`, `REFUTED`, `TIMEOUT`, `UNKNOWN`, `ERROR` |
| assuranceLevel | Enum | `L0`, `L1`, `L2`, `L3` |
| evidence | JSONB | Prover-specific output: proof artifact path, counterexample, log, duration |
| verifiedAt | Instant | When the verification ran |
| expiresAt | Instant (nullable) | When this result should be re-verified (code changed, dependency updated) |

The graph stores VerificationResult nodes connected to Requirement nodes and TraceabilityLink nodes. A single Cypher query can answer: "Show me all security requirements where no verification result has achieved L2 in the last 30 days."

### 3. Assurance levels as universal framework

ADR-012's assurance levels (L0-L3) are a **methodology**, not a tool binding. The level definitions are universal; the tools at each level depend on the target language and abstraction:

| Level | Methodology (universal) | Ground Control's Own Code | Platform Output (polyglot) |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| L0 | Tested | `javac` + JUnit 5 | Language-native compiler + tests |
| L1 | Contracted | JML `requires`/`ensures` + JUnit 5 | Language-appropriate contracts: JML, ACSL, Verus annotations, type contracts, `requires` clauses |
| L2 | Design/Property-Verified | jqwik + TLA+ design specs | TLA+/Alloy for design; jqwik, proptest, Hypothesis, QuickCheck for properties; OpenJML ESC where applicable |
| L3 | Formally Proven | KeY (future, for own code) | Dafny, Lean 4, KeY, Frama-C/WP, Verus — matched to target language |

### 4. TLA+ for design-level verification

TLA+ is adopted for verifying Ground Control's own design-level properties:

| Property | Scope | What TLC Checks |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| State machine completeness | Requirements lifecycle | All states reachable, no deadlocks, transition table covers all enum values |
| DAG invariant preservation | Requirement relations | Concurrent `createRelation` calls cannot introduce cycles |
| Materialization consistency | AGE graph sync | After sync completes, graph is a faithful projection of ORM state |
| Traceability completeness | Impact analysis | If requirement R changes, traversal reaches all dependent artifacts |
| Verification pipeline | Orchestration | No verification result is stored without prover confirmation |

TLA+ specs live in `specs/tla/` at the repository root, versioned with code. TLC model checking runs as part of the verification pipeline.

Implementation is staged. The repository now carries versioned TLA+ specs and policy sync tooling that keeps verification-oriented ADR and quality-gate metadata aligned, while the `VerificationResult` domain entity and verifier adapters remain future implementation work.

### 5. Separation of concerns

| Concern | Scope | Tools |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Ground Control's own code quality | Internal dogfooding | JML L1 contracts + jqwik + JUnit 5 + TLA+ design specs |
| Platform verification capabilities | User-facing feature | Pluggable verifier backends, orchestration, graph-stored results |
| Verification UX | Future | Natural language -> formal spec translation (likely Dafny-based, per MSR prototype pattern) |

Ground Control uses formal methods internally (dogfooding) AND provides formal methods orchestration as a platform capability. These are separate concerns with separate tooling.

### 6. Domain structure for verification

```
domain/
    requirements/           # Existing (ADR-011)
    verification/           # New domain area
        model/
            VerificationResult.java
            VerifierType.java         # Enum of known provers
            VerificationStatus.java   # PROVEN, REFUTED, TIMEOUT, UNKNOWN, ERROR
        service/
            VerificationService.java  # Stores results, queries verification status
        repository/
            VerificationResultRepository.java

infrastructure/
    verifiers/              # Adapter layer for external provers
        VerifierAdapter.java          # Interface: verify(target, property) -> result
        OpenJmlAdapter.java           # Calls OpenJML ESC on Java source
        TlcAdapter.java              # Calls TLC on TLA+ specs
        OpaAdapter.java              # Calls OPA on Rego policies
        # Future: FramaCAdapter, VerusAdapter, DafnyAdapter, KeyAdapter
```

The `infrastructure/verifiers/` package follows the ports-and-adapters pattern: `domain/` defines what a verification result looks like; `infrastructure/` knows how to invoke specific provers.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Platform can verify software in any language — not limited to Java
- Graph-based traceability works across verification tools: the differentiator is preserved and strengthened
- Security use case is viable: threat model -> security requirement -> formal property -> language-specific proof -> graph-stored evidence
- Design-level verification via TLA+ is immediately actionable, high-ROI, and proven at AWS scale
- No rearchitecting needed when adding new prover backends
- Compliance evidence generation (DO-178C, ISO 26262, IEC 62304) works regardless of which prover produced the evidence — the graph connects requirements to verification results uniformly
- The Infer pattern (invisible formal methods in CI) is achievable: users push code, the platform runs appropriate verifiers, results appear in the graph

### Negative

- More abstraction upfront than a JML-only pipeline
- Each new prover backend requires an adapter implementation
- TLA+ is a new tool to learn (mitigated: 2-3 week learning curve per AWS experience; high ROI for design-level bugs)
- The platform must maintain adapter compatibility as provers evolve

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Orchestration layer adds complexity without enough backends to justify it | Start with 2 backends (OpenJML for Java dogfooding, TLA+/TLC for design specs). Add backends as the platform's verification features are built out. |
| TLA+ specs drift from implementation | Specs are versioned with code. Spec-to-implementation review is part of the SDD workflow. TLC runs in CI. |
| Prover-agnostic result schema loses prover-specific nuance | The `evidence` JSONB field stores raw prover output. The schema captures universal properties (proven/refuted/timeout); JSONB preserves prover-specific details (counterexamples, proof terms, coverage metrics). |
| Too many verification tools to maintain | Ground Control orchestrates — it doesn't maintain the provers themselves. Each backend is a thin adapter (~100-200 lines) calling an external tool's CLI or API. |
| VerificationResult expiry/staleness is hard to track | `expiresAt` field combined with TraceabilityLink's `syncStatus` flag stale results when source artifacts change. Graph queries surface "verification gaps" — requirements with expired or missing results. |

## Implementation Status

- **§2 VerificationResult entity** — Implemented (GC-F001). Domain: `domain/verification/`, API: `api/verification/`, Migrations: V049-V050, MCP: 5 tools.
- **§6 infrastructure/verifiers/ adapters** — Not yet implemented. Future work per individual prover requirements.

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-005** (Apache AGE) — The graph is the integration point for multi-prover verification results. Cypher queries span requirements, traceability links, and verification results.
- **ADR-011** (Requirements Data Model) — TraceabilityLink connects requirements to verification targets. VerificationResult connects to both.
- **ADR-012** (Formal Methods Development Process) — SDD methodology and assurance levels remain valid and are now explicitly universal. Tool bindings per level depend on target language.
- **ADR-013** (Java/Spring Boot Backend Rewrite) — Java/JML/OpenJML remain the choice for Ground Control's own code. This ADR separates internal dogfooding from platform capabilities.
