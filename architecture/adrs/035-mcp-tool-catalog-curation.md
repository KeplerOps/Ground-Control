## Context

Issue [#628](https://github.com/KeplerOps/Ground-Control/issues/628) (audit
finding A12-03, severity:medium) flagged that the Ground Control MCP server
registered 215 tools across 39 sections in `mcp/ground-control/index.js`.
Every tool's name, description, and Zod input schema is loaded into every
connected LLM client at session start, regardless of whether the session is
doing requirements work, an `/implement` run, risk modelling, or pack-registry
administration.

The surface was the result of mirroring every REST endpoint as its own
named MCP tool — `gc_create_X`, `gc_get_X`, `gc_list_X`, `gc_update_X`,
`gc_delete_X` for thirty-plus entities, plus seven near-identical graph-
traversal tools, plus history / timeline / export / diff variants for many
of them. Three failure modes followed:

1. **Catalog noise.** Tens of KB of tool definitions in the LLM context on
   every connect. The seven graph-traversal tools alone (`gc_get_relations`,
   `gc_get_descendants`, `gc_get_ancestors`, `gc_find_paths`,
   `gc_find_graph_paths`, `gc_extract_subgraph`, `gc_traverse_graph`,
   `gc_analyze_impact`) all answer the same shape of question; an agent that
   does not already know which one to call burns calls discovering it. The
   pattern repeats for asset, risk, threat-model, and control families.
2. **Maintenance burden.** Every new backend endpoint required a new MCP
   tool registration, a new Zod schema, a new test, and another line in the
   LLM-visible catalog. Endpoint additions naturally accelerate this; the
   surface had grown from 203 (audit time) to 215 at the time of this ADR.
3. **Long-tail self-service gap.** No curation could ever cover every "I
   have a hypothesis, let me check it" join an agent might need; the only
   escape was "load more tools," which makes the noise problem worse.

The accepted boundaries (preflight notes, ADR-026, ADR-027, ADR-029,
ADR-031, ADR-032, ADR-034) constrain the solution:

- The Spring REST API (governed by ADR-026's bearer-token + path-matrix
  authorization chain) is the semantic authority. MCP tools are adapters
  over it; they must not become a second controller layer.
- Workflow tools that encode `/implement` gates —
  `gc_get_repo_ground_control_context`, `gc_codex_architecture_preflight`,
  `gc_post_implementation_plan`, `gc_codex_review`, `gc_codex_verify_finding`
  — must remain first-class and named.
- Hiding a tool from a client catalog is a usability decision, not an
  authorization decision. Authorization remains the backend's responsibility.
- The MCP adapter must reuse `buildUrl`, `addAuthorizationHeader`, `request`,
  `RequestError`, and `parseErrorBody` from `mcp/ground-control/lib.js`.
- The READ-only escape hatch must be path/method allowlisted, relative
  `/api/v1/...` only, and not accept caller-supplied headers or methods.
- Cypher passthrough is forbidden by ADR-032; any read-only escape hatch
  must be REST-only.

## Decision

Adopt a **two-part design**: aggressive **consolidation** of named MCP tools
plus a **read-only `gc_query` escape hatch** for the long tail.

### 1. Consolidation: one tool per entity, action-discriminated

The 215 `server.tool(...)` registrations collapse to ~26 named tools. The
target is "drastic reduction without capability loss." Every backend
operation reachable through MCP today remains reachable; what changes is
how many distinct tool names sit in the LLM-visible catalog.

**Workflow primitives (kept by name — the `/implement` and `/ship` skills
call these by name in their SKILL.md prose):**

- `gc_get_repo_ground_control_context`, `gc_codex_architecture_preflight`,
  `gc_post_implementation_plan`, `gc_codex_review`, `gc_codex_verify_finding`,
  `gc_create_github_issue`, `gc_dashboard_stats`, `gc_query`,
  `gc_get_requirement`, `gc_get_traceability`, `gc_get_traceability_by_artifact`,
  `gc_create_traceability_link`, `gc_delete_traceability_link`,
  `gc_transition_status`, `gc_bulk_transition_status`.

**Consolidated entity tools (one per entity, action-discriminated):**

- `gc_requirement` — list, create, update, delete, archive, clone.
- `gc_relation` — create, get, delete.
- `gc_adr` — create, update, delete, transition, requirements.
- `gc_document` — create, update, delete, grammar_set, grammar_delete, reading_order.
- `gc_section` — create, update, delete, tree, content_add, content_update, content_delete.
- `gc_asset` — create, update, delete, archive, relation_create, relation_delete,
  detect_cycles, impact_analysis, extract_subgraph, link_create, link_delete,
  external_id_create, external_id_update, external_id_delete.
- `gc_observation` — create, update, delete, latest.
- `gc_risk_scenario` — create, update, delete, transition, requirements,
  link_create, link_delete.
- `gc_threat_model` — create, update, delete, transition, link_create, link_delete.
- `gc_control` — create, update, delete, transition, link_create, link_delete.
- `gc_risk_governance` — covers methodology_profile, risk_register_record,
  risk_assessment_result, treatment_plan, verification_result; action discriminator
  is `{entity, action}`.

**Compute-heavy operations (kept as their own tools, mode-discriminated):**

- `gc_analyze` — cycles, orphans, coverage_gaps, impact, cross_wave, consistency,
  completeness, status_drift, similarity, work_order.
- `gc_graph` — ancestors, descendants, paths, find_paths, subgraph, visualization,
  traverse.
- `gc_baseline` — create, delete, snapshot, compare.
- `gc_quality_gate` — create, update, delete, evaluate.

**Admin / deployment operations (opt-in via `GC_MCP_ADMIN=1`):**

- `gc_admin` — import_strictdoc, import_reqif, sync_github, sync_github_prs,
  embed_requirement, embed_project, embedding_status, materialize_graph,
  create_project, list_projects, run_sweep, run_sweep_all, export_*.
- `gc_pack` — subsystem-discriminated `{subsystem, action}` over plugin,
  control_pack, registry, trust_policy, install. Includes the read actions
  (`list_*`, `get_*`, `list_pack_versions`) that previously had their own
  named tools — `gc_query` cannot reach `/api/v1/pack-registry/**` (the path
  is denylisted), so pack reads stay on the named tool.

The admin gate (a single `GC_MCP_ADMIN` env-var check) is the only piece of
catalog-style filtering that survives the consolidation. Previously the
entire MCP surface ran through a catalog filter; with the consolidated
surface, gating only matters for the admin-shaped operations — every other
tool is safe to register unconditionally because it lacks a `ROLE_ADMIN`-
gated path.

**Pure GETs move onto `gc_query`.** History, timeline, exports, list-by-X,
get-by-id for niche entities — none of these get their own MCP tool. The
agent issues a `gc_query` call with the appropriate `/api/v1/*` path.

**Action discriminator schema shape.** Each consolidated tool registers
with a `z.object({...}).strict()` schema where one required field
(`action`, `kind`, `mode`, `subsystem`, or `entity` + `action`) is a Zod
enum and all action-specific fields are optional at the schema level. The
handler dispatches on the discriminator and validates required fields per
action with a small `reqArg(args, key, action)` helper that throws a
descriptive error when a required field is missing. The tool's description
enumerates the actions and the per-action required fields so the LLM has
the contract in context.

**Why not a strict `discriminatedUnion` schema?** The MCP SDK's input-
shape acceptance varies; a flat ZodObject with optional fields is robust
across SDK versions. The handler-side `reqArg` check is the actual gate.
The cost is slightly looser type information in the JSON Schema sent to
clients, but the description text fills the gap.

### 2. `gc_query` (read-only REST escape hatch)

A new MCP tool registered always (it is part of the workflow primitives
above). It accepts:

- `path` — a relative path matching the strict regex `^[A-Za-z0-9/_.-]+$`,
  starting with one of an explicit allowlist of `/api/v1/*` prefixes.
  Absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, paths containing `..`, paths
  containing `%` (encoded-dot bypass guard), query strings or fragments
  embedded in the path, and any path outside the allowlist are rejected
  before any network call.
- `params` — an optional flat object of query parameters. Values must be
  `string | number | boolean | null`. Arrays and nested objects are
  rejected.

The tool **only issues GET requests**. There is no `method` parameter; HTTP
verb cannot be supplied. Headers cannot be supplied; `addAuthorizationHeader`
adds the bearer token, and the request always emits
`Accept: application/json` plus `X-Actor: mcp-server`.

**Path allowlist** (canonical source: `GC_QUERY_PATH_ALLOWLIST` in
`mcp/ground-control/gc-query.js`): `/api/v1/adrs`, `/api/v1/analysis`,
`/api/v1/assets`, `/api/v1/audit`, `/api/v1/baselines`, `/api/v1/controls`,
`/api/v1/dashboard`, `/api/v1/documents`, `/api/v1/graph`,
`/api/v1/methodology-profiles`, `/api/v1/observations`, `/api/v1/projects`,
`/api/v1/quality-gates`, `/api/v1/relations`, `/api/v1/requirements`,
`/api/v1/risk-assessment-results`, `/api/v1/risk-register-records`,
`/api/v1/risk-scenarios`, `/api/v1/sections`, `/api/v1/threat-models`,
`/api/v1/timeline`, `/api/v1/traceability`, `/api/v1/treatment-plans`,
`/api/v1/verification-results`. A drift-catch test compares this list
against the README and this ADR on every test run.

**Denylist:** `/api/v1/admin/**`, `/api/v1/embeddings/**`,
`/api/v1/analysis/sweep/**`, `/api/v1/pack-registry/**` are rejected even
though they live under `/api/v1/`. Backend auth (ADR-026) would also reject
them; the denylist is defense in depth and produces clearer errors.

**Cost cap.** 30-second timeout via `AbortController` whose signal stays
armed through body consumption (the timer is cleared only when
`executeGcQuery` returns). 1 MiB response-body cap enforced by streaming
the body and canceling the reader once the cap is reached — the request
does NOT buffer unbounded data before truncating. The cap covers the full
request lifetime, not just header arrival.

**Strict Zod schema.** `gc_query` is registered with a strict ZodObject so
the MCP SDK's input validation rejects unknown keys (`headers`, `method`,
etc.) at the protocol layer before the handler runs. The handler
additionally enforces the same key allowlist as defense in depth.

**Error semantics.** Validation errors are wrapped as `RequestError` with
`status: 0` and codes `invalid_query_path`, `invalid_query_params`,
`invalid_query_args`, or `gc_query_timeout`, so the existing `err()`
renderer in `index.js` surfaces them in the same envelope shape as backend
errors.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **86 % reduction in the LLM-visible tool catalog** (215 → ~30 named
  tools) without losing any backend capability. Every endpoint reachable
  before remains reachable, either through a consolidated named tool or
  through `gc_query`.
- The seven-way graph-traversal cluster collapses into one `gc_graph` tool
  with a mode discriminator. The CRUD-five-per-entity pattern collapses
  into one tool per entity. The maintenance overhead of "one tool per
  endpoint" becomes "one tool per entity."
- `gc_query` closes the long-tail "let me check this hypothesis" gap
  without expanding the write surface or letting agents construct
  Cypher (ADR-032). An agent that finds no curated tool covering a join
  it needs can issue a constrained GET and read the answer.
- Workflow tools the `/implement` skill calls by name are unchanged. The
  skill prose does not need to be rewritten in this PR.

### Negative

- Each consolidated tool's description is longer than the single-purpose
  tools it replaces, because it has to enumerate actions and per-action
  required fields. Net LLM context still drops sharply because the count
  drops dramatically; per-tool size is larger but the count multiplier is
  far smaller.
- The handler-side `reqArg(args, key, action)` validation is runtime, not
  static. The LLM-visible JSON Schema does not encode "field X is required
  when action=create." Agents have to read the description.
- `gc_query`'s path allowlist must be maintained as the backend surface
  evolves. New read endpoints land outside the agent's reach until someone
  adds them to the allowlist. This is intentional (default-deny); the
  README documents the maintenance step.

### Risks

- **Action-set drift.** A new action added to an entity's lib.js function
  needs to be added to the corresponding consolidated tool's enum + switch.
  An action with no test coverage that drops out of the switch will fail
  silently at runtime. Mitigation: the action enum is the only source of
  truth in the schema; if a switch case is missing for a listed enum
  value, the handler's default branch returns an "Unknown action" error,
  which is loud at first call.
- **Allowlist lag.** A new `/api/v1/**` read endpoint will be unreachable
  via `gc_query` until the allowlist is updated. Default-deny is correct;
  the README documents this.
- **Body truncation hides material data.** 1 MiB is ample for typical
  lookups; large exports use the dedicated `gc_admin` export actions.

## Alternatives considered

- **Hide-by-default via env-var-selected catalog tags** (the original
  approach in an earlier draft of this PR). Rejected: it reduces LLM
  context per session but does not reduce the maintenance surface; the
  source still has 215 tools to keep working. The user explicitly asked
  for "drastic reduction" and "lose complexity, not capability."
- **Generic `gc_call_api(path, method, body)` escape hatch covering
  writes too.** Rejected: an agent that can issue arbitrary writes via
  a generic proxy bypasses the per-action Zod schema that captures the
  domain shape. Splitting into a read-only `gc_query` plus action-
  discriminated write tools preserves the schema contract on the write
  side.
- **Cypher passthrough via `gc_query`.** Rejected by ADR-032.
- **Strict `z.discriminatedUnion`** per tool. Rejected: SDK acceptance
  is variable; flat ZodObject + handler-side `reqArg` is robust and the
  description carries the contract.
