# ADR-025: Backup Policy (GC-P021)

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-04-19

## Context

GC-P021 is a non-functional policy that the production Ground Control
deployment must meet:

> The Ground Control production deployment shall have its persistent data
> backed up at least three times per day, with at least twenty-four (24)
> hours of backup retention. Backups shall cover all persistent state
> required to restore the system to an operational condition. Restoration
> from backup shall be verified on a recurring basis and documented such
> that recovery can be performed without prior knowledge of the live
> system.

ADR-018 established the AWS EC2 deployment with two independent backup
layers:

1. **Logical** — `pg_dump -Fc` via cron on the EC2 host → local dump on the
   `/data` volume + S3 (`groundcontrol-backups-catalyst-dev`, versioned,
   SSE-S3, public-access-blocked, 30-day lifecycle).
2. **Block-level** — AWS Data Lifecycle Manager daily EBS snapshots of the
   `/data` volume, 7-day retention.

Restore tooling:

- `/opt/gc/restore.sh` — restore-in-place from a local dump or S3 key,
  with a pre-restore safety backup.
- `/opt/gc/test-restore.sh` — throwaway-container restore of the latest
  dump, invoked weekly (Sunday 05:00 UTC) via cron.

The defaults under ADR-018 were:

- Backup cadence: `0 3 * * *` (once daily at 03:00 UTC).
- Local retention: 3 dump files.
- Verification cadence: weekly.
- Verification checks: count of public-schema tables and Flyway migration
  rows only.

These satisfy GC-P009 ("configurable automated backups with defined
retention and tested restore") but do not satisfy GC-P021:

- Cadence is 1×/day, not 3×/day.
- Verification is weekly and does not exercise Apache AGE — the restored
  database could be silently missing the AGE extension or its catalog and
  the existing checks would still pass.
- Recovery documentation is embedded in `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md`
  and mixes local-dev with prod instructions; it does not meet the
  "recovery without prior knowledge" bar.

Issue #533 proposed replacing the logical backup path with **pgBackRest**
(block-level Postgres backup with WAL archiving). Two reasons make that
path the wrong choice for this deployment:

1. **Apache AGE data is derivative.** The authoritative state for
   requirements, relations, documents, sections, threat models, risk, and
   traceability lives in relational tables governed by Envers auditing.
   `AgeGraphService.materializeGraph()` rebuilds the AGE graph from those
   tables (see
   `backend/src/main/java/com/keplerops/groundcontrol/infrastructure/age/AgeGraphService.java`).
   Preserving the AGE graph at byte-for-byte fidelity is not required — a
   post-restore `materializeGraph` call re-derives it from restored
   relational data.
2. **Operational cost outweighs the benefit.** The deployment is a single
   `t3a.small` (2 vCPU / 2 GB RAM). Enabling pgBackRest's archive-command
   and WAL shipping adds a continuous Postgres workload and new
   sidecar/host process for a single-tenant dev tool. GC-P021 does not ask
   for PITR finer than the backup cadence, so the additional machinery
   buys nothing we need.

## Decision

Retain the ADR-018 two-layer backup architecture (pg_dump + EBS) and
raise the defaults so GC-P021 is met:

1. **Cadence** — `backup_cron` default changes from `0 3 * * *` to
   `0 3,11,19 * * *` (8-hour interval, 3×/day). Override is still allowed
   but the variable description records that any override must remain
   ≥ 3×/day to stay compliant.
2. **Retention** — `local_retention_count` default raises from 3 to 4
   dump files, guaranteeing > 24 h retention at 3×/day cadence with a
   one-run margin. S3 lifecycle stays at 30 days (cost-governed, already
   ≥ 24 h).
3. **Verification cadence** — the restore-test cron changes from weekly
   (`0 5 * * 0`) to daily (`0 5 * * *`).
4. **Verification depth** — `deploy/scripts/test-restore.sh` and the
   inlined copy in `deploy/terraform/modules/compute/user-data.sh.tftpl`
   now additionally assert:
   - AGE extension is present (`pg_extension` row).
   - Core Ground Control tables are present (`project`, `requirement`,
     `requirement_relation`, `traceability_link`, `document`, `section`,
     `threat_model`).
   - V010 (`create_age_graph`) appears in `flyway_schema_history`.
   - `create_graph('requirements_verify')` succeeds against the restored
     catalog — this proves AGE is operationally usable, not just installed.
5. **Documentation** — a new standalone runbook lives at
   `docs/operations/backup-restore.md`. It is written for an operator with
   AWS console access, Tailscale credentials, and no prior exposure to
   Ground Control internals; it is executable end-to-end without
   consulting other documents.
6. **Script rollout** — because `deploy/terraform/modules/compute/main.tf`
   declares `ignore_changes = [ami, user_data]`, Terraform cannot rewrite
   `/opt/gc/*.sh` on the live instance on updates. The CI `deploy` job
   closes that gap: after `terraform apply` and before running
   `/opt/gc/deploy.sh`, it `aws ssm send-command`s the contents of
   `deploy/scripts/install-ops-scripts.sh` to the running instance with
   the GC-P021 env vars (`GC_BACKUP_BUCKET`, `GC_BACKUP_CRON`,
   `GC_LOCAL_RETENTION_COUNT`). The installer is idempotent, enforces
   the ≥ 3×/day cadence and ≥ 4-file retention floors on input, and
   rewrites `/opt/gc/{backup,restore,test-restore,watchdog}.sh` plus the
   three `/etc/cron.d/gc-*` entries on every deploy. First-boot
   provisioning uses the same installer, keeping one source of truth.
7. **Drift protection** — `scripts/assert-backup-policy.sh` is a
   structural check over the Terraform module and env vars, the inlined
   user-data copy, the canonical `deploy/scripts/test-restore.sh`, and
   the installer. It also executes the installer against an ephemeral
   prefix to prove (a) it refuses non-compliant inputs and (b) it
   writes the expected files and substitutions. It runs in pre-commit
   and `make policy` and fails the build if cadence, retention, cron,
   verification, or CI-workflow wiring drifts away from the GC-P021
   defaults. `scripts/test-backup-restore-locally.sh` is a second
   guardrail: it stands up a fresh apache/age container, replays every
   Flyway migration, dumps, and exercises `test-restore.sh` against the
   dump end-to-end, asserting every sentinel check.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Zero architecture churn — reuses the existing backup/restore tooling.
- Verification now catches AGE-specific regressions that the previous
  table-count check would have missed silently.
- Daily verification shrinks the blind window between "backup taken" and
  "backup proven restorable" from up to 7 days to at most 24 h.
- The standalone runbook lets any operator execute recovery cold.
- The structural assertions prevent accidental regression of the
  GC-P021-critical defaults in future Terraform or script changes.

### Negative

- Not true PITR — effective RPO is the cadence interval (~8 h). GC-P021
  does not require finer PITR, but teams that grow tighter RPO needs must
  revisit this ADR.
- 3× more S3 PUTs and roughly 3× S3 storage for local + S3 copies.
  At ~500 MB per dump × 30-day retention this is still pennies per month,
  but the ADR records the trade-off for future cost review.
- pg_dump runs against the live container; at current data volume
  (low-single-digit GB) it completes in seconds, but a future order-of-
  magnitude growth may require moving to online physical backup.

### Risks

- **AGE extension drift** — if a future Postgres or AGE image upgrade
  changes the catalog layout, a dump taken pre-upgrade may fail to
  restore post-upgrade. Mitigation: verification runs against the same
  `apache/age:release_PG16_1.6.0` image tag pinned in
  `docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`, and the
  `user-data.sh.tftpl` inline `test-restore.sh`. A version upgrade touches
  all three and invalidates this ADR; a new ADR is required at that time.
- **Verification container cold-start flakiness** — the apache/age image
  briefly restarts after its first boot. `test-restore.sh` now waits for
  three consecutive successful `SELECT 1` calls before restoring. If the
  restart window ever exceeds the 120-second wait, verification fails
  loudly rather than silently — acceptable behaviour.
- **Backup cron failures that silently fall under retention** — at 4-file
  local retention and 3 runs/day, two consecutive failed backups still
  leave ≥ 24 h of valid dumps. Three consecutive failures would drop
  retention below the policy; operators rely on
  `/var/log/gc-backup.log` + the daily restore-test failure to catch
  this.
