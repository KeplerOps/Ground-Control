# ADR-029: Issue-Thread Gate Model

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-03

> **Amended by issue #906 (2026-05-13):** Two changes to the review-loop contract this ADR establishes. (1) **Pre-push Codex review default cap drops from 3 → 1** (the cap value lives on the MCP tool as `CODEX_REVIEW_PREPUSH_HARD_CAP` and is now overrideable per-repo via `.ground-control.yaml::workflow.codex_review.pre_push_cap`, bounds `[1, 10]`); the `override_cap=true` + `override_reason=<authorization quote>` escape is unchanged and continues to grant a single over-cap cycle. Empirical rationale: PR #903 (a 4-cycle run) showed cycles 2–3 partly compounding the agent's own fix-introduced bugs rather than catching net-new bugs, and CI / SonarCloud / human review cover the residual risk. (2) **Test-quality review moves pre-push** to a new Step 6.6 in the same local-iteration band as the codex pre-push review (former Step 13 is merged out; former Step 14 collapses into Step 10's existing CI watch). Test-quality's default cap also drops to 1 with the same `workflow.test_quality_review.pre_push_cap` override path. The `gc:test-quality-review-cycle` marker family and the `gc_post_decision_record` contract are **unchanged** — what moves is the placement of the step in the workflow, not the durability mechanism. The PR now opens with both AI-assisted reviewers clean; CI + SonarCloud + human reviewer are the only post-push gates. SKILL.md Steps 13 / 14 are intentional tombstones; downstream Step 15 / 18 / 19 numbering is preserved so external references don't track a moving target. See `skills/implement/SKILL.md` Step 6.5 / 6.6 for the operative loop prose and `architecture/notes/quickfix-workflow-lane-preflight.md` for the preflight design context.

## Context

ADR-021 ("Gated Agentic Development Loop") and the prior GC-O007 statement
required two human touchpoints per `/implement` run: **plan approval** and
**PR merge**. Plan approval was implemented as `EnterPlanMode` followed by
explicit user sign-off before TDD began.

In practice, plan approval became ceremony. Empirically, more than 95% of
plans were accepted as-is. The synchronous gate added coordination tax (the
human had to be available at the moment the plan was ready) without
materially affecting outcomes — divergences from the plan were caught by
review steps later in the loop, not by the plan-approval gate.

Pulsar already operated under a non-conformant model in which the plan was
posted as a GitHub issue comment and the workflow proceeded directly to TDD.
ADR-027 ("Agent-Neutral Implement Workflow Packaging") initially treated
this as a transport choice — `plan.approval_gate=issue-comment` — but the
ADR-027 author flagged that proceeding without an approval signal would
violate GC-O007's two-touchpoint contract. That conflict prompted this ADR.

## Decision

GC-O007's contract is amended to **one human touchpoint: PR merge**. The
GitHub issue thread becomes the durable record of plan, review findings,
and decisions on findings.

### Touchpoints

- **PR merge** is the only synchronous human gate. The user reviews the issue
  thread (plan + findings + decisions) and the PR diff, then merges.
- **No plan-approval gate.** The `/implement` skill posts the plan to the
  GitHub issue as a comment via `gh issue comment` and proceeds directly to
  TDD. No `EnterPlanMode` call. No synchronous user-approval wait.

### Issue thread as durable record

Every artifact that previously implied a human gate is now recorded as a
comment on the GitHub issue:

- **Plan** — posted as a comment when `/implement` enters Phase A. Includes
  context, approach, files-to-change, verification steps, risks.
- **Review findings** — every finding from codex review, refactor review,
  test-quality review, and SonarCloud is posted to its native location (PR
  review comment for codex; issue comment summary for review aggregates).
  The issue thread carries a summary linking back to the PR comments.
- **Decisions on findings** — for every finding, the agent records its
  disposition as an issue comment: **fix**, **wontfix**, or
  **not-applicable**, with a one-line rationale. `defer` is not a valid
  decision: the workflow's contract is "fix every finding before PR is
  ready." Recording the disposition is mandatory; agent silence on a
  finding is treated as a process violation.
- **Status transitions and traceability reconciliation** — happen
  asynchronously in Phase D (after reviews), not in a synchronous gate.

### Replaces / amends

- **ADR-021** is **amended**, not superseded. Its phase structure (A/B/C/D)
  and gate ordering are preserved. Only the human-touchpoint count changes
  from 2 → 1, and plan publishing moves from `EnterPlanMode` → `gh issue
  comment`.
- **ADR-027** drops its "transport not bypass" clause; plan publishing is
  uniformly the issue-comment transport, with no synchronous approval.
- The `plan.approval_gate` config knob proposed in #791 is NOT introduced —
  the gate model is uniform, not configurable per repo.

### Reviewer-of-record invariant (preserved)

ADR-027's invariant that codex remains the reviewer of record stays in
effect. Reviews route through `gc_codex_review`, `gc_codex_verify_finding`,
and `gc_codex_architecture_preflight` regardless of which agent runtime
drives the workflow.

### Pre-push review cycle state

Pre-push `gc_codex_review` runs with `uncommitted=true` are the canonical
Codex review step. The later post-push invocation is retained only as a
tool-layer defense-in-depth path for direct callers; the `/implement` skill
must not drive a second Codex review after the first push. Merge-commit drift
relative to the target branch is covered by CI, integration tests, and
SonarCloud, not by a duplicate Codex pass.

Because the workflow now has one Codex review step instead of two, the
`gc_codex_review` hard cap is **configurable per repo** (per the issue #906
amendment above). The MCP tool's module defaults are 1 cycle pre-push and
3 cycles post-push; the pre-push default may be overridden via
`workflow.codex_review.pre_push_cap` in `.ground-control.yaml`. The cap
remains anchored per issue (pre-push) and per PR (post-push); branch is
audit context, not part of the cap key.
`gc_codex_verify_finding` remains capped at two calls per
finding because verification loops are per-finding, not whole-review cycles.
Any older workflow text, issue prose, or ADR amendment that refers to a
five-cycle Codex cap, a hard two-cycle `gc_codex_review` cap, or two Codex
review steps is stale and must not drive implementation without a new ADR
amending GC-O007.

Because the pre-push review has no PR issue number, its durable cycle state is
anchored to the GitHub issue resolved at workflow Step 1. The marker records
the current branch name as audit-only context — the cap counter itself is
keyed by issue alone, so a branch rename on the same issue cannot reset the
counter. Earlier drafts of this ADR had the cap keyed by `(issue, branch)`,
but PR #800 review (cycle 2) flagged that as a bypass: a noncompliant agent
could rename `<issue>-x` to `<issue>-x-2` and start fresh. Per-issue keying
closes that path. Legitimate "abandon and restart on a new branch" remains
available via the user-authorized `override_cap=true` + `override_reason`
path; the override marker stays distinguishable from regular cycle markers in
the audit trail.

The configured cap (default 1 per #906; per-repo override via
`workflow.codex_review.pre_push_cap`, bounds `[1, 10]`) is hard against agent
self-authorization: the agent cannot run cycle cap+1 to "verify the fix" of
the previous cycle's findings. Last-in-cap findings must be fixed in place;
if concern remains after fixing them, the agent posts an issue-thread comment
summarizing the remaining concern and fix history and escalates to the user.
The user may then authorize cycle cap+1 explicitly via `override_cap=true`
+ an `override_reason` quoting that authorization, or decide a different
workflow move (stop, re-scope, open a fresh issue). The marker preserves the
distinction so the audit trail records whether each cycle ran in-cap or under
user-authorized override.

The marker belongs to the same issue-thread marker family as plan, phase,
review-cycle, and verify-cycle markers. Implementations must reuse the
existing issue-comment read/post helpers, marker parser/evaluator pattern, and
structured refusal result style; they must not add a local state file, git
notes, database row, Temporal state, or driver-local counter for this cap.

### Tool-layer enforcement boundary

The MCP server is the enforcement boundary for workflow ordering, cycle caps,
GitHub posting, and durable markers. Implementation work for issue #794 must
extend the existing MCP review/phase machinery rather than introducing a
parallel workflow state model.

Reuse these existing cross-cutting patterns:

- the `ensureGitRepo` and `getOwnerRepo` repository resolution path before any
  GitHub or git side effect;
- the issue-comment marker family and paginated issue-comment reader for
  durable state, including marker-shaped-text escaping so reviewer output
  cannot poison counters;
- pure parser/evaluator helpers for marker counting and prerequisite decisions,
  with tests covering malformed markers, wrong issue/PR ids, and cap
  boundaries;
- structured refusal envelopes with stable `error`, `message`, `prior_cycles`
  or `missing`, `cap`, and `next_action` fields instead of thrown control-flow
  exceptions for expected gate failures;
- the host-side GitHub posting boundary, sensitive-content guardrail, and
  partial-failure envelopes already used by `gc_codex_review`;
- `.ground-control.yaml` resolution through `gc_get_repo_ground_control_context`
  when workflow behavior needs repo configuration.

Do not duplicate the workflow contract in skill-only prose, local files, git
notes, in-memory counters, ad hoc JSON blobs, Temporal state, or a new database
table for this bridge implementation. Do not create separate schemas for
pre-push and post-push review cycles unless their persisted marker identity
actually differs. Do not make branch name, PR number, or commit lineage part of
the pre-push cap key; those are audit context or post-push direct-caller
defense-in-depth context, not reset levers for the canonical Step 6.5 cap.

### Test-quality review uses the same decision-record contract

The test-quality review step (Step 6.6 per the #906 amendment; formerly
Step 13) via the `gc_test_quality_review` MCP tool records every cycle on
the issue thread using the same `gc_post_decision_record` surface as
Step 6.5's codex review, with `reviewer: "test-quality"` and the findings
list.

The reviewer was originally a Skill (`review-tests`) but issue #884 v2
moved it to an MCP tool to fix a behavioral regression: the Skill-tool
boundary produced prose-formatted findings, and the autoregressive
parent agent kept echoing them back to the user as a status report
instead of fixing them in the same turn. The SKILL.md "do not echo,
fix in same turn" prose could not override the tool-boundary bias.
The `gc_test_quality_review` MCP tool returns a structured envelope
with a `next_action` field — the parent reads it as a directive, not
as text to summarize. See
`architecture/notes/test-quality-review-engine.md` for the full
mechanism (claude CLI exec wrapper, OAuth vs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
auth, cycle cap markers, findings record, failure modes). A clean cycle posts `findings: []`, which renders as
`**Findings:** 0 (clean run)`. The successfully posted record is the
structured durable signal that the cycle is complete and the workflow
advances — and "successfully posted" is dispositive: the parent advances
to Phase C (stage / commit / push) only after `gc_post_decision_record`
returns `ok: true` with a posted comment id/url. On `ok: false`, the parent
follows the returned `error` / `next_action` envelope (sensitive-content
rejection, body-size cap, `gh` posting failure, network), fixes the
underlying issue, and retries the post — it does NOT enter Phase C with
the durable marker missing. Treating the attempted call as the signal would
re-open the #884 silent-advance failure mode in a different shape. There is
no separate marker family for test-quality cycles, and there is no human
acknowledgment turn between the test-quality clean signal and Phase C —
the parent `/implement` workflow consumes the successful clean record and
proceeds in the same turn. (Per the #906 amendment, the former Step 13 /
Step 14 post-PR phase merged into Step 6.6 pre-push + Step 10 CI watch;
the contract above is unchanged in substance — the "advance" target just
shifted from Step 14 to Phase C entry.) Issue #884 was the original regression — when the SKILL prose
treated the `review-tests` skill's human-readable "no issues found" line
as the only signal, the parent agent stopped at the skill-return boundary
instead of advancing. The skill's prose line remains for transcript
readability; the decision-record marker on the issue thread is the
workflow contract.

The cycle cap for test-quality defaults to 1 per issue (per the #906
amendment above), aligned with the codex pre-push cap default. It is
configurable per repo via `workflow.test_quality_review.pre_push_cap`
in `.ground-control.yaml`. Per #884 v2 the cap is **server-side**: the MCP tool
`gc_test_quality_review` counts `gc:test-quality-review-cycle` markers
on the issue thread and refuses cycle 4 unless `override_cap=true` with
a non-empty `override_reason`. The marker family is disjoint from
`gc:codex-prepush-cycle` and `gc:decision-record`; the three counters
never cross-count. Branch is recorded for audit context only — a
branch rename on the same issue does NOT reset the counter.

The whole point of the test-quality review is to **fix** the tests, not
to file a status report on them. The MCP tool returns a structured
envelope with `findings[]` and `next_action`; the parent /implement
agent reads `next_action` as a directive. On
`next_action: "fix_findings_and_reinvoke"` the parent fixes every
finding in the same agent turn (classify, apply the fix, self-verify,
commit/push, post the decision record with `fix` / `wontfix` /
`not-applicable` dispositions, re-invoke). On
`next_action: "post_clean_decision_record_and_advance_to_phase_c"` the
parent posts the clean `gc_post_decision_record(findings: [])`,
confirms `ok: true`, and proceeds to Phase C (stage / commit / push) in
the same turn. (The string changed from `..._advance_to_step_14` to
`..._advance_to_phase_c` when issue #906 moved Step 13's test-quality
review pre-push to Step 6.6; Step 14 no longer exists.) The
parent does NOT echo findings back to the user — the v1 prose-only
attempt to forbid that behavior failed because the Skill-tool
boundary's autoregressive bias overrode the SKILL.md rule; the v2 MCP
tool boundary closes that bias by returning structured `next_action`
rather than prose findings.

### Codex findings issue-thread record

After every successful `gc_codex_review` cycle, the MCP server must post a
human-readable findings record to the resolved GitHub issue thread. That
comment is the durable record for "what Codex said in cycle N"; agent-written
decision summaries remain a separate record of what the agent did with each
finding.

The findings record must preserve the existing machine-readable cycle marker
contract and include:

- cycle number, cap, reviewer names, and review mode (`pre-push` or
  `post-push`);
- the verbatim `core_review_text` and `security_review_text` returned by the
  reviewers;
- for post-push reviews, every inline PR review comment URL that was created.

Post-push inline PR review comments still exist for anchored human review.
The issue-thread findings comment is additive, not a replacement for inline
comments. If posting the issue-thread findings record fails, the review run is
not durable and must fail fast with a structured
`review_comment_post_failed` result while preserving the review text and
finding metadata in the returned payload.

Implementations must route this through the existing host-side GitHub posting
boundary in `gc_codex_review`: use the same `gh api` issue-comment helpers,
secret-content guardrails, parser/evaluator result envelopes, and
issue-resolution logic already used for phase markers, cycle markers, and
inline PR comment posting. Do not let Codex call `gh` directly, do not create a
second GitHub client abstraction, and do not make agent prose the only source
of truth for review findings.

The cap mechanism is an audit / discipline gate, not a security boundary. A
fully noncompliant or compromised agent with shell access has many paths to
bypass — the cap narrows the most likely accidental-bypass path (branch
rename) but does not protect against all attacks. The user's PR merge
remains the only synchronous human gate.

### `defer` is not a valid disposition

The "Decisions on findings" bullet above states the contract in one sentence:
`defer` is not a valid decision. Issue #830 documented that agents kept
inventing a third path anyway — "out of scope for this PR; follow-up issue to
track it", "will be addressed in a subsequent PR", "deferred to a later
iteration", or simply writing "deferred"/"TBD" in a closing comment without
filing anything. Once the issue closes, the deferred item has no anchor: not
in the requirement graph, not in any tracker, not on any backlog. It is
silent debt. This subsection makes the prohibition explicit and names its
mechanical enforcement.

**The only valid dispositions for a reviewer finding are:**

1. **`fix`** — the finding is fixed now, in the same diff. For a *class*
   finding (one instance of a pattern that recurs), the fix is designed at
   the category level — a structural gate, a shared helper, a parameterization,
   a single point of repair — and applied to every instance at once, not
   whack-a-mole to the reviewer-named site only. Fixing a `class` finding on
   the named site alone is a process violation in the same shape as silent
   deferral: it leaves the category un-addressed and burns a review cycle the
   cap is not meant to absorb.
2. **`wontfix`** — the finding is genuinely wrong, dangerous to fix in
   context, or a false positive. Requires **explicit user authorization** on
   the issue thread, quoted in the disposition comment.
3. **`not-applicable`** — the finding does not actually apply (false positive
   on this codebase, out of the diff's real scope, etc.), recorded with a
   rationale.

**Deferral language — forbidden.** "Defer this to a follow-up PR / issue /
later iteration / subsequent commit", "will be addressed in a follow-up",
"fixed in a subsequent PR", "handled as a follow-up issue", and — in a
comment that closes or reports completion on the issue under implementation —
a bare "deferred", "TBD later", or "to be done later/separately" are all
deferral dispositions. Filing a tracking issue does **not** convert a deferral
into a valid disposition; the contract is fix-or-escalate, not fix-or-file.
A new issue's own body legitimately scope-bounds future work (an
`## Out of scope` section, a "this builds on #N" note) — that is scope
*definition*, not finding *deferral*; the distinction is by phrase, not by
section heading.

**Mechanical enforcement — two defense-in-depth layers over the same
contract, neither replacing the other:**

- **Tool-call time** — the PreToolUse hook `.claude/hooks/block-defer-language.py`
  (installed via `scripts/bootstrap-claude-workflow.sh`'s `WORKFLOW_HOOKS`
  allowlist, registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `PreToolUse[Bash]`
  chain) inspects `gh issue {create,edit,comment,close}` and
  `gh pr {create,edit,comment}` body/title text — including heredoc bodies —
  and blocks the call (exit 2) on deferral-disposition language, routing the
  agent back to fix-or-escalate.
- **Completion gate** — `bin/policy` (`tools/policy/checks.py`'s
  `run_no_deferral_disposition_check`) scans the resolved PR body for the same
  Tier-1 deferral phrases at completion-gate / CI time.

Both layers share one classifier; `tools/policy/deferral_cases.json` is the
golden-case file both test suites load, so the hook's standalone copy and the
policy copy cannot drift without a test failing. The classifier's allowed
contexts are encoded in those cases, not in agent prose — future tuning is
reviewable.

**Text scanning is necessary, not sufficient.** A scanner cannot prove an
agent *silently dropped* a finding it never wrote about. That failure mode —
"agent silence on a finding is a process violation" from the bullet above —
is caught only by reconciling the issue-thread Codex findings record (every
cycle's verbatim finding list) against the agent's disposition comments
(one `fix`/`wontfix`/`not-applicable` rationale per finding). The hook and
policy layers catch *written* deferral language; the findings-vs-decisions
reconciliation is the existing control for *unwritten* omission and is
unchanged by this amendment.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One synchronous gate instead of two: the workflow proceeds asynchronously
  after `/implement` is invoked. The user sees the result on PR ready-to-merge
  rather than being interrupted mid-run.
- Issue thread becomes a single durable surface that survives PR merge/close,
  unlike PR review comments which are tied to the PR's lifecycle.
- Plan, findings, and decisions are colocated and time-ordered, making
  retrospective audit easier than scraping multiple surfaces.
- Aligns the four current repos on a single gate model — pulsar's prior
  divergence becomes the new norm rather than a fork.

### Negative

- Removing the synchronous plan-approval gate transfers accountability for
  early-stage course correction onto the codex preflight + plan content
  itself. If preflight is weak or the plan is wrong, the workflow proceeds
  to TDD against a flawed plan, and the cost of rework is higher than
  catching it at plan-approval time.
- Issue threads become longer. Plans + finding summaries + decisions can
  accumulate to hundreds of lines per `/implement` run.

### Risks

- **Agent silence on finding decisions.** Without a human approval gate,
  agents could silently mark findings wontfix without rationale.
  Mitigation: every finding decision is mandated as an issue comment with
  rationale; the codex `verify_finding` flow already enforces this on PR
  comments. Issue-thread duplication is the new explicit step.
- **Drift in plan quality.** Plans that previously got rubber-stamped will
  now drive TDD without that rubber-stamp gate. If plan quality erodes,
  it'll show up in larger review-fix loops. Counter: the codex preflight
  + plan-rules-from-`.ground-control.yaml` already shape plans before TDD;
  this is the same input quality, just without a synchronous human pause.
- **Audit retrospective.** When a PR ships with bad code, the question
  "did the human approve this?" no longer has a yes/no. Counter: the issue
  thread is the durable record; reviewers can trace what was known and
  what was decided.

## Migration

- **This PR (#791)** lands ADR-029 simultaneously with the canonical
  `skills/implement/SKILL.md` rewrite that follows the new gate model.
- **In-flight work** under the old gate model finishes under the old gate.
  This PR itself is being executed under the deprecated plan-approval gate
  (which the user explicitly granted before this ADR was authored). Future
  `/implement` runs use the new gate.
- **GC-O007 statement** is amended via `gc_update_requirement` in this PR
  to reflect one human touchpoint and the issue-thread durable-record
  model. The prior statement remains in `gc_get_requirement_history` for
  audit.

## Non-Goals

- Eliminating PR review or merge approval. PR merge stays a synchronous
  human gate.
- Making the workflow fully autonomous. The user still owns merge and
  remains accountable for ratification of the work.
- Re-implementing `EnterPlanMode` as a Codex feature. Codex-driven
  `/implement` runs use the same `gh issue comment` plan transport as
  Claude-driven runs.
