# Ground Control Knowledge Base Log

Append-only chronological record of knowledge-base activity — ingests,
sweeps, lint passes, and manual corrections. Newest entries go at the top.
Never rewrite past entries; append a correcting entry instead.

Each entry follows this shape:

```
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — short description. Source: <citation>.
```

## Entries

- `2026-04-12` — Knowledge base skeleton created (this file plus
  `SCHEMA.md` and `index.md`) as the first slice of the agent knowledge
  system rollout. No content pages yet; the inbox, capture primitive, and
  ingest engine land in later slices. Source: `issue:522`.
